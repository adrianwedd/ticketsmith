It involves a formal process of engaging with all relevant stakeholders to elicit, document, and ratify the core business objectives the AI agent system is intended to solve. A clear definition of use cases and quantifiable success metrics is paramount, as these will guide all subsequent architectural decisions, feature prioritization, and evaluation efforts. Without this clarity, the project risks scope creep and an inability to measure return on investment. This is not merely a documentation exercise; it is the strategic bedrock of the entire initiative.[1, 2]"

  description: "This critical task involves making foundational architectural decisions about the core technologies that will power the agent system. The choice of an LLM agent framework is particularly significant, as it dictates the fundamental approach to agent orchestration and interaction. A framework like LangGraph provides explicit state management and is ideal for building complex but predictable and auditable enterprise workflows.[3, 4] In contrast, a framework like AutoGen, which relies on emergent agent-to-agent conversation, offers more dynamism but can be less predictable and harder to debug in a production environment.[5, 6] This decision is therefore not just technical but strategic, balancing the need for autonomy against the requirement for control and reliability. The selection process must also cover LLM inference engines, databases, and other key dependencies."
