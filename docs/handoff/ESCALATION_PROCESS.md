# Support Escalation Process

This document defines how issues are escalated from the support team back to the development team.

1. **Triage** – Support reviews incoming tickets and attempts to resolve using the runbooks.
2. **Escalate to Operations Lead** – If a ticket requires code changes or is unresolved after initial troubleshooting, escalate to the Operations Lead.
3. **Create GitHub Issue** – The Operations Lead opens a GitHub issue referencing the customer ticket and assigns it to the appropriate developer.
4. **Communication** – Keep the original reporter updated via the ticketing system. Major incidents trigger a Slack channel notification to #on-call.
5. **Resolution and Documentation** – After the fix is deployed, document the root cause and steps taken in Confluence.
