# ISMS Policy Manual

TicketSmith maintains an Information Security Management System (ISMS) aligned with ISO/IEC 27001.
This manual defines the scope of the program, outlines leadership responsibilities, and lists our security objectives.

## Scope
The ISMS covers all TicketSmith infrastructure, applications, and data processed on behalf of customers and employees.

## Leadership Commitment
Executive management provides resources and direction for implementing and continuously improving the ISMS.
The SecurityLead is accountable for day‑to‑day operation of the program and reports progress during management review meetings.

## Objectives
- Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of company and customer data.
- Ensure compliance with contractual and regulatory obligations.
- Drive ongoing risk reduction through regular assessments and corrective actions.

All ISMS policies, procedures, and assessment reports are stored in Confluence at <https://confluence.example.com/display/TS/ISMS> for auditor reference.

## Internal Audits and Management Review
Periodic internal audits are performed according to the [Internal Audit Program](INTERNAL_AUDIT_PROGRAM.md). Results are discussed during management review meetings to drive continuous improvement.
