# BAA Management Workflow

Use this process to negotiate, execute, and store Business Associate Agreements with vendors that handle PHI.

## Partners Requiring BAAs

| Partner | Service | BAA Required |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| OpenAI | GPT-4o API | Yes |
| Atlassian | Jira/Confluence | Yes |
| AWS | Hosting Infrastructure | Yes |

## Negotiation and Execution

1. Determine if a new vendor will access or store PHI. If so, create a Jira ticket referencing the BAA template.
2. Send the template to the vendor and track redlines in the ticket.
3. Once terms are agreed, obtain signatures via DocuSign.
4. Store the executed agreement in the Compliance/BAA space in Confluence.
5. Update the vendor log with execution and renewal dates.

Executed BAAs must be easily accessible for auditors in Confluence.
