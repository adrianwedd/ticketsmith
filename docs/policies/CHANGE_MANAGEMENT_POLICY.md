# Change Management Policy

All changes to production systems must follow a documented approval process.

- Propose changes through a pull request linked to a Jira ticket.
- Peer review is required before merging.
- High-risk changes need system owner approval.
- Emergency fixes may be deployed immediately but must be reviewed within one business day.
- Each change record includes deployment steps and rollback procedures.
