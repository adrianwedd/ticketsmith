# Continuous Monitoring and ATO Procedures

This document describes the FISMA continuous monitoring program for TicketSmith and outlines the Authority to Operate (ATO) process.

## Continuous Monitoring Requirements
- Track security control status using automated tooling where possible.
- Generate daily reports on vulnerability scan results and open findings.
- Review access control logs and privileged actions on a weekly basis.
- Maintain dashboards that display compliance control status and open remediation items.
- Alert the Security Lead when monitoring detects control failures or suspicious activity.

## Authority to Operate Process
1. **Preparation** – Define the system boundary and gather required documentation, including the system security plan and risk assessment.
2. **Security Assessment** – Perform testing to validate that implemented controls satisfy NIST 800‑53 requirements.
3. **Authorization Package** – Compile assessment results, plan of action and milestones, and residual risks for review by the Authorizing Official.
4. **Decision** – The Authorizing Official issues an ATO letter if risk is acceptable. Otherwise, deficiencies must be remediated.
5. **Continuous Monitoring** – After issuance, maintain the ATO by tracking control effectiveness and addressing findings on an ongoing basis.
