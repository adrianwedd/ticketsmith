# DPA Execution Workflow

Follow this process to negotiate, execute, and store Data Processing Agreements with customers and vendors.

1. Determine if the engagement involves personal data of EU residents. If so, create a Jira ticket referencing the DPA template.
2. Send the template to the counterparty and track any redlines within the ticket.
3. Obtain signatures via DocuSign once terms are agreed.
4. Store the executed agreement in the Compliance/DPA space in Confluence.
5. Update the vendor or customer log with execution and renewal dates.

Executed DPAs should be readily available for auditors within Confluence.
