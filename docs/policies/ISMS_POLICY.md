# Information Security Management System (ISMS) Policy

TicketSmith maintains an Information Security Management System to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data and systems. Management is responsible for reviewing this policy annually and ensuring resources are available for compliance.

Key principles:

- Security responsibilities are defined for all personnel.
- Risks are identified and treated according to the methodology in the Risk Register.
- Policies and procedures are published in Confluence and kept up to date.

- The full ISMS manual and risk assessment results are stored in Confluence for auditors.
