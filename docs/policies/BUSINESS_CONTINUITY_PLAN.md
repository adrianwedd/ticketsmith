# Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan

This plan ensures TicketSmith can continue critical operations during disruptive events.

- Daily backups of databases and configuration are stored in geographically separate locations.
- Critical staff contact information is maintained in the incident response wiki.
- Cloud infrastructure can be restored in a new region using infrastructure-as-code templates.
- Tabletop exercises are performed annually and results are recorded in Confluence.
