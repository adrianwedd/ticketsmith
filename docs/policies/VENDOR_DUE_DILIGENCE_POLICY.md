# Vendor Due Diligence Policy

TicketSmith assesses vendors for security and compliance risks before engagement.

1. Complete a vendor risk questionnaire covering data handling and control maturity.
2. Review security certifications and recent audit reports.
3. Require contractual commitments for breach notification and data protection.
4. Track ongoing monitoring results in the vendor log and review annually.
