# Production Deployment and Scaling Strategy

This document outlines how to deploy TICKETSMITH in a resilient, scalable manner. It covers autoscaling rules, load balancing, deployment methodology, and backup procedures.

## Auto-Scaling

- **Application and inference services** should run in a container orchestration platform such as AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or an equivalent PaaS that supports horizontal scaling.
- Configure a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) or platform-specific autoscaling rules:
  - Scale out when CPU or GPU utilization exceeds 70% or when request rates surpass predefined thresholds.
  - Scale in when utilization drops below 30% to control costs.

## Load Balancing

- Place an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or similar layer-7 proxy in front of the application pods.
- The load balancer distributes requests across all running instances and terminates TLS connections.
- Health checks should be configured to remove unhealthy instances from rotation automatically.

## Blue-Green / Canary Deployments

- The GitHub Actions workflow promotes images from staging to production.
- Extend this pipeline to deploy new versions alongside the existing release:
  1. Deploy the new image to a "green" environment or a small canary subset of pods.
  2. Run smoke tests against the new deployment.
  3. Gradually shift traffic via the load balancer. Roll back automatically if health checks fail.
- Once validated, scale down the old "blue" environment so zero downtime is achieved.

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

- Use automated PostgreSQL backups (e.g., daily snapshots to S3 or the database provider's backup service).
- Store encryption keys and credentials in the chosen secret manager.
- Enable storage encryption for the PostgreSQL database and S3 buckets using provider-managed KMS keys.
- Document the restoration process:
  1. Provision a new database instance.
  2. Restore from the most recent snapshot.
  3. Redeploy application services pointing to the restored database.
- Regularly test restoration in a staging environment to ensure backups are valid.

Following this plan satisfies Task 604 by providing a clear scaling and disaster recovery approach.
